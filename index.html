      <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on the 27th of January 1756 in Salzburg, Austria. His father Leopold Mozart was a teacher and music composer. Leopold would teach the clavier to Wolfgang’s older sister “Nannerl”. Wolfgang, then aged 4, started playing
        with her. He was evidently apt and delicate with the instrument. At five, the young Wolfgang was already composing. Under his father’s tutelage, Wolfgang’s talents developed.</p>

      <p>was the year Wolfgang and Nannerl began traveling with their father. They would perform as child prodigies for various courts. During one of their trip, Wolfgang heard composer Gregorio Allegri’s piece Misere twice in Rome’s Sistine Chapel. From
        memory alone, he was able to write it down. </p>

      <p>Back home in Salzburg, Mozart was employed as a court musician for the benefit of Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. There, he gained the admiration of many. But it only took him a few ears to grow tired of his position. The low salary and
        few opportunities to compose operas, made him resign from the Salzburg court. </p>

      <p>After unsuccessful ventures in Bavaria and Paris, Mozart returned to Salzburg in Archbishop Colloredo’s court. Colloredo asked Mozart to accompany him to Vienna for a trip. During the trip, Mozart was still pursuing employment outside of Salzburg.
        He successfully managed to perform for Vienna’s emperor whom granted him a part-time position. Colloredo tried to stop Mozart from playing outside his own establishment which led to an acrimonious conflict between them. Mozart ultimately resigned
        from his Salzburg position. </p>

      <p>Mozart had success in Vienna. He was seen as the “finest keyboard player in Vienna”. In August, he married Constanze Weber. They had 6 children but four of them died in infancy. Karl Thomas Mozart and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart survived, the latter
        becoming a music composer.</p>

      <p>In Vienna, Mozart read the work of Bach and Handel. Their word influenced Mozart’s style. Mozart also met composer Haydn with whom he became friends. Mozart and Constanze moved in an expensive apartment and hired servants spending everything Mozart
        was earning due to his success. In this period, Mozart composed Operas, including the famous Don Giovanni. In 1787, Mozart was employed in a steady position by Emperor Joseph II as chamber composer.</p>

      <h3 class="years">1788</h3>
      <p>The beginning of the Austro-Turkish proved to be a challenging period for Mozart. Vienna’s high society suddenly had very little money for artistic patronage. Mozart had to move in the suburbs of Vienna and repeatedly beg friends to lend him money.
        This period saw him compose his 40th symphony in G minor, perhaps his most famous piece.</p>

      <p>In the last year of his life, Mozart improved his financial situation. He also composed a lot, including The Magic Flute and his famous unfinished Requiem. In September, Mozart fell ill during the premiere of La Clemenza Di Tito. He carried on his
        professional duties until November. He was then bedridden and very preoccupied with the fact that he still had not finished his Requiem. On the 5th of December 1791, Mozart died in his home. He was buried in Vienna. Not long after his death, Mozart’s
        work gained a newfound popularity. </p>
